## Introduction

The Kotlingerless Quiz is a simple quiz made using Kotlin and android API. Players have to go through a series of questions in order to score points. 
At the end of the quiz, is displayed the total score of the current players along with a scoreboard of players' scores stored in a database. 

**In order to learn what the XML markup language really is, the design of the app has been entirely made coding in XML, meaning that no drop-down elements have been used during this project.**
