# The_Kotlingerless_Quiz

*This was created during my time as a student at Code Chrysalis*

## Project

The The Kotlingerless Quiz is a simple quiz made using Kotlin and android API. Players have to go through a serie of questions in order to score points. 
At the end of the quiz, is displayed the total score of the current players along with a scoreboard of players' scores stored in a database. 
**The Database is not connected yet to the application although the back-end is all finished**

In order to learn what the XML markup language really is, the design of the app has been entirely made coding in XML and no drop-down elements have been used during this project.
